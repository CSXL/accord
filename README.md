`Simple integration` solution using `microservice` architecture.
 
## Description
 
Accord is going to be CSXL's open source, highly-customizable, scalable, and simple integration solution. Many current integration solutions are either too trivial or complex because of their monolithic architecture. To beat this complexity issue, Accord will be composed as a series of detached microservices and tools. This project is geared towards individuals and enterprises who need to implement specific tools and integrations in a scaleable way without hitting their head against their keyboard.
 
If you are looking for an integration hub we highly recommend [Open Integration Hub](https://github.com/openintegrationhub/openintegrationhub), which is a huge inspiration for this project. Our project is more trivial and made to fit our internal workflow.
